    <h2>Description</h2> 
Creative Coding Lab explores the fundamentals of computer programming and web development through a series of creative projects. The course aims to equip students with the skills to develop web-based applications that use the JavaScript language and the p5.js environment and include a significant computational component. Fundamental concepts, such as variables, functions, control flow, arrays, loops and object-oriented programming, are applied to create generative visuals, interactive experiences, and internet art projects. This course is intended for students with no prior programming experience.
